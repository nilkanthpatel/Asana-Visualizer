Basically, we used to need the lig script because older versions of InDesign didn't always put ligs in automatically. But in the later versions that should be fixed (according to Kilian). If it is fixed, then we can get rid of that bit of code in Pat's lig script (but keep the rest of the script). Pat's script replaces what should be ligs with glyphs, causing spell check to choke. If we get rid of that part of the script  then ligatures will not show up as spelling errors in incopy, and more ppl from copy said they would use spell check. Ty is particularly interested in a fix.

What understandings or expectations have Google and CND worked out?\n\nA key concern is upload/download time for proofing on the device each week – we'll let you know what we find in terms of speed.\n\nAlso critical is Staging environment to be in sync with production in terms of release version, meaning no lag between updates to proofing app. We're also looking for proofing in the staging environment is identical to production so that files do not need to be reproofed when in production. If reproofing is required, we'd be looking for the ability to send it to production and see results as quickly.\n\nAlso critical is ample time for testing new viewer versions–we generally need two weeks.\nWhat is to be expected in terms of opting or forcing app updates to the user base? This, along with legacy support, helps us understand if we must support implementations for an array of versions in the wild.\n\nTNY requires that no content be released before the prescribed all-edition publish time which is currently 12:01 A.M. Mondays, and if it's to be later, we should discuss. Is this workable?\n\nWe prefer and request a production process that does not require CND staff to be onhand at publication time in order to make the issue live (either Google staff, or automation does the trick), and occasionally we post (double) issues one or more weeks in advance. \n\nWe're looking for Google's support to be on-call as needed from the time of upload of weekly edition (we expect to upload anywhere from Friday night, occasionally Friday day during our short close weeks) through release.\n\nWhat is the current and expected state in terms of ability to publish revisions, and require the user to update them?

Here's a quick rundown of how to use some of them:\n\n1. Coverwrap -- Open up a copy of the coverwrap in CS4 K4 (read only) and then run the script. It should ask for the 10inch HTML template for the cover, so just point it to that file.\n2. TOC -- Same as Coverwrap--open up K4 read-only, and select the TOC HTML file\n3. Talk+Comment -- It'll just ask for the HTML template for the stack you'd like to create (script will figure out whether it's talk or comment and everything else)\n4. Dept+Well+Critics -- Just select the folder with the two template files for the stack you'd like to create (folder must have dummy text template files saved with the right filenames and ending in \"_h\" and \"_v\")\n5. Back Page -- Same as Coverwrap/TOC--open up K4 read-only, run the script, choose the HTML file\n6. IMPORTANT: you can't run this without having all the cartoons renamed with the number order in front of the file name. Cartoons Stack -- you'll first need to open up the Master Cartoon Templates for both h and v, and then save them as indesign files with the correct filenames, ending in _h and _v in the cartoons stack folder. Then, run the script. It'll ask you to select the Horizontal template indesign file. Then, it'll ask you to choose the folder with the iPad cartoons, full-size, named with the numbers in the front.\n\nAlso, I have a script that makes the HTML cartoon galleries for 7 and 10. It's in Tablet Scripts > All Devices > Galleries > Cartoons Slideshow. All you have to do is run it and it'll ask you to select this week's Cartoons folder in Tablet Orange. It should do the rest, but sometimes, it doesn't do a good job of copying the 7 image files in both sizes, so you may have to do that part manually (it should get the HTML right though).\n\nGOOD LUCK AND let me know if you have any questions/need anything.\n\nNEEL","assignee":{"id":1469682145343},"due_on":null,"followers":[{"id":1460420595334},{"id":1469682145343},{"id":1464815905408},{"id":1464825634245}]},{"id":2759792377581,"created_at":"2012-12-13T16:30:53.172Z","name":"send 'thank you' email to intern applicants","notes":"I'll come up with a nice response to thank them.

It didn't hurt anything because the app ignored it, but we should expire everything so that the feed is cleaner and more lightweight. to do this, simply expire as normal - save a past date in end date, then mark for web. next day, check the feed and confirm all are removed. \n\n2. email Munnuru, Naveen <Naveen_Munnuru@condenast.com>; Cutlerywala, Abdulkadir <Abdulkadir_Cutlerywala@condenast.com> Kolosov, Victor <Victor_Kolosov@condenast.com>\n\nto let them know we've expired all content and they can proceed with a plan i emailed them about to change the feed pull so that festival content is thereafter excluded\n\n3. update the wiki so that we a) all know about the festival section in MT, it's purpose, which is only to export xml for the app, and b) include info about goat app that the feed pulls in one section or another based on a list of sections/blogs that naveen/victor manage, and for changes we need to coordinate","assignee":{"id":1079321680265},"due_on":null,"followers":[{"id":1464815905416},{"id":1079321680265},{"id":1460420595334}]},{"id":3756586296322,"created_at":"2013-01-23T17:14:33.108Z","name":"Innovators ezine production","notes":"Pub date of 3/4","assignee":{"id":1464825634245},"due_on":null,"followers":[{"id":1464825634245},{"id":1464815905408}]},{"id":2774386278927,"created_at":"2012-12-14T23:45:30.035Z","name":"Issue pdf: ads/inserts/robyn","notes":"","assignee":{"id":1469687217965},"due_on":null,"followers":[{"id":1460420595334},{"id":1469687217965},{"id":1464815905408}]},{"id":2791953734433,"created_at":"2012-12-18T05:13:09.757Z","name":"long term:","notes":"","assignee":null,"due_on":null,"followers":[{"id":1460420595334}]},{"id":2791953734435,"created_at":"2012-12-18T05:13:13.790Z","name":"7-inch ezines!","notes":"","assignee":null,"due_on":null,"followers":[{"id":1460420595334}]}]}, { "name":"Cartoons", "id":1631020953798, "tasks": [{"id":5522115620631,"created_at":"2013-05-21T15:07:29.059Z","name":"Change cartoon format from .gif to .jpg","notes":"Sasha said we could save a significant amount of filesize by resizing cartoons to .jpg instead of .gif format, and also gain an increase in visual quality (especially in the SD versions).

How do we move onto HTML-based captions so we can dynamically resize cartoons on stack creation?\n\nWe already export captions from print to elements XML, but this is not copy checked. This got me thinking...the captions are copy-checked on the caption cards, and we manually enter the corrected/checked captions back into the Cartoon Bank database. Can we build into the stack creation script some kind of process like:\n\n1. script looks at elements XML for all elements in the stack (opener, spot art, toons, etc.)\n2. when it comes across a toon, it somehow looks up that A-number in the Cartoon Bank database and imports the caption text from the final \"caption as run\" field\n3. script resizes the cartoon images to spec and adds caption text to stack HTML\n\nIn step #3, the script would need to be able to position the image+caption correctly. \n\nOR, there could be a separate script to import all captions from the database to elements XML, to be run when captions are checked Friday afternoon/evening.\n\nAlternative: we could also keep the current process for manually attaching the caption text to the cartoon images via iViewMedia Pro. Then the stack creation script would look for the caption text in the EXIF data in each image. But this seems less reliable to me because iView sometimes fails, and it depends on manual intervention to make sure the correct captions are attached to all cartoons.","assignee":{"id":1464815905416},"due_on":null,"followers":[{"id":1469687217965},{"id":1469682145343},{"id":1464815905408},{"id":1460420595334},{"id":1079321680265},{"id":1464825634245},{"id":1464815905416}]},{"id":1631020953807,"created_at":"2012-08-30T21:25:34.577Z","name":"back-end investigation","notes":"","assignee":null,"due_on":null,"followers":[{"id":1460420595334},{"id":1464825634237},{"id":1464815905416}]},{"id":2253602555098,"created_at":"2012-10-24T03:14:30.050Z","name":"cartoons - any kind of scripting helpful","notes":"project down the line. put ideas here!","assignee":null,"due_on":null,"followers":[{"id":1464815905408},{"id":1464825634245},{"id":1079321680265},{"id":1464825634237},{"id":1460420595334},{"id":1469687217965},{"id":1464815905416},{"id":1999764150945},{"id":1469682145343}]},{"id":2253602555101,"created_at":"2012-10-24T03:17:59.808Z","name":"Cartoons: training night shift","notes":"Train Night Shift on the Cartoon Resizing process to free up Derrick.

How do we move onto HTML-based captions so we can dynamically resize cartoons on stack creation?\n\nWe already export captions from print to elements XML, but this is not copy checked. This got me thinking...the captions are copy-checked on the caption cards, and we manually enter the corrected/checked captions back into the Cartoon Bank database. Can we build into the stack creation script some kind of process like:\n\n1. script looks at elements XML for all elements in the stack (opener, spot art, toons, etc.)\n2. when it comes across a toon, it somehow looks up that A-number in the Cartoon Bank database and imports the caption text from the final \"caption as run\" field\n3. script resizes the cartoon images to spec and adds caption text to stack HTML\n\nIn step #3, the script would need to be able to position the image+caption correctly. \n\nOR, there could be a separate script to import all captions from the database to elements XML, to be run when captions are checked Friday afternoon/evening.\n\nAlternative: we could also keep the current process for manually attaching the caption text to the cartoon images via iViewMedia Pro. Then the stack creation script would look for the caption text in the EXIF data in each image. But this seems less reliable to me because iView sometimes fails, and it depends on manual intervention to make sure the correct captions are attached to all cartoons.","assignee":{"id":1464815905416},"due_on":null,"followers":[{"id":1469687217965},{"id":1469682145343},{"id":1464815905408},{"id":1460420595334},{"id":1079321680265},{"id":1464825634245},{"id":1464815905416}]},{"id":5507876078500,"created_at":"2013-05-20T21:52:22.033Z","name":"Smarter share URLs","notes":"Add a parameter that indicates which edition (3, 7, or 10) the share originated from.","assignee":{"id":1464815905416},"due_on":"2013-06-07","followers":[{"id":1464815905416},{"id":1460420595334},{"id":1464815905408},{"id":1464825634245},{"id":1469687217957},{"id":1469682145343}]},{"id":5470267051545,"created_at":"2013-05-16T19:35:56.629Z","name":"email share on DE - new link","notes":"migrate to a bitly and more humble link on all devices:\n\n\nSubscribe to The New Yorker now: [a nice, neat bitly link] \n\n<a href=\"http://cnstud.io/mobile_ads/tny/2012_08_06/TNYOrderLanding/OrderLanding/promo/link_only\">Subscribe to The New Yorker now</a>","assignee":{"id":1464815905416},"due_on":null,"followers":[{"id":1460420595334},{"id":1464815905408},{"id":1464825634237},{"id":1464825634245},{"id":1079321680265},{"id":1464815905416}]},{"id":5369101530813,"created_at":"2013-05-08T23:15:06.170Z","name":"Test linking to new Realview build on as many devices as possible","notes":"We can give NTv an overview of functionality across devices for eventual linking to archive edition from digital editions.","assignee":{"id":1464825634245},"due_on":null,"followers":[{"id":1464825634245},{"id":1460420595334},{"id":1464815905408}]},{"id":5305068995098,"created_at":"2013-05-03T19:20:38.166Z","name":"send images to jeff louden","notes":"Jeff is going to take a look at our DE images to see what kinds of compression, elminiation of meta etc can reduce file size!

This happens because the event has a record in MT GOAT when the event is in previews and another record when the event has opened and there's a longer edtiorial review. The editors are supposed to include  \"<!--nonapp-->\" in the title of the latter record so the system can keep track of which is the early version and which is the later version. Unfortunately the logic of how search is set up wasn't done correctly and we have duplicates in search.\n\nAll this is background and there's more to explain to fully understand it, but bascially the task at hand is to generate a list of all the events in GOAT MT that contain the \"<!--nonapp-->\" designation in the title field, so that we can later manually go into our search index and delete the duplicates. \n\nSo if you can have someone help you get into MT (use the old version of firefox - should be on your machine), and perhaps use the search field in the upper right. There may not be an export feature so you may have to copy/paste or get creative. \n\nIf that ends up being easy enough, the second phase will be to go through the list you generated, and for each listing, find in MT the equivalent entry that does not have \"nonapp\" in the title (for instance your list will have \"Rigoletto <!--nonapp-->\" so you should look for \"Rigoletto\"), open it, then look in the field in the upper right, I think it's called \"base name\" or \"base post\" and record the value next to the \"nonapp\" event in your list. That's the info we'll need later to do the manual deletion.\n\nGood luck!
